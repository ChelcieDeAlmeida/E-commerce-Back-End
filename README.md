## **_Description_**

## **_Technologies Used_**  
* JavaScript
* NodeJS

## **_Installation_**
Note: users are expected to know some JavaScript

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't done so yet.
* You should also have pulled this repository at this point (we'll get to Node in second)
* On your project directory, you will initialize npm by typing ```npm init```
* After that command runs a series of processes, you're ready to use npm.
* Type ```npm i``` on the root of the repo you've just pulled. This will fetch all of the project dependencies making it possible for Node to use the functionality provided by the project. 
* At this point, the project is ready but before that, make sure you've set up:
    * 1. A ```.env``` file at the root of the project directory with the following properties:
            * DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
            * DB_USER='root'
            * DB_PW='Your DB password'
    * 2. MYSQL locally, it's important as it's the basis for this project.
    * 3. Download Insomnia to test out your routes (Optional)
* After you've successfully met the conditions outlined above, follow the videos below:
